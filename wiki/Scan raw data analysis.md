## Processing using BWS-diagnostic GUI

Another way to process the data is to use the **BWS-diagnostic expert application**. It has the advantage of not using any code and allows to **test the processing with different parameters** before launching a complete calibration processing. On the other hand you can't process several calibration at once (which in something to avoid in order to adapt each parameters sets for the different calibrations)

Follow the steps:

1. Go on the upper tab `Caibration processing`
2. Choose your tdms folder in `TDMS folder`
3. Choose your destination folder in `Destination folder`
4. Test the processing with the actual `parameter.cfg` file in `Test processing`
5. Adjust the parameters by opening `parameter.cfg` by clicking `Set parameters`
   - Repeat step 4. et 5. until the desired processing in reached
6. Click on `Process`
7. See directly the results by clicking `Show PROCESSED data` or follow the [single calibration analysis](Single calibration analysis)

And you are done üëç
